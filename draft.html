            <h2>VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK</h2>
            
            <p class="intro-text">
                Volcanoes National Park is Rwanda’s premier gorilla trekking destination and the oldest national 
                park in Africa, established in 1925 to protect the endangered mountain gorillas. Recognised by 
                UNESCO as a World Heritage site, located just 2–2.5 hours from Kigali, it is the most accessible 
                place in the world to trek mountain gorillas. The park is part of the Virunga volcanic range and 
                home to mountain gorillas, golden monkeys, more than 200 bird species, and iconic volcanoes 
                like Karisimbi, Bisoke, Sabyinyo, Gahinga, and Muhabura. 
                Visitors travel here mainly for gorilla trekking, an emotional and unforgettable experience that 
                takes you through bamboo forests to meet a gorilla family in its natural habitat.  
            </p>

                <p>
                    Travelers often ask about trekking difficulty, best time to visit, gorilla permit prices, altitude, and the overall 
                    experience. The park is safe, well-managed, and offers year-round trekking with professional 
                    rangers who make every visit smooth and meaningful. 
                    Volcanoes National Park is also a model of conservation and responsible tourism. Community
                    based programs, revenue sharing, and long-term partnerships have helped wildlife recover and 
                    improved life for surrounding villages. Tourism supports schools, clean water, employment, and 
                    conservation education. Local communities proudly welcome visitors. 
                    A powerful example is the Gorilla Guardian Village (Iby’Iwacu), where former poachers 
                    transformed into cultural ambassadors and protectors of the park. Through music, dance, 
                    storytelling, and traditional activities, they share their journey from survival-driven poaching to 
                    becoming leaders in conservation. Visiting this community after gorilla trekking supports 
                    livelihoods and strengthens the future of Rwanda’s wildlife. 
                    Seek Wild Africa offers well-organized gorilla trekking tours, golden monkey tracking, volcano 
                    hikes, cultural visits, and private transfers from Kigali. We secure your gorilla permits, provide 
                    expert guides, and design trips that are safe, responsible, and deeply memorable. Your visit 
                    helps protect the gorillas and supports the communities that safeguard them.
